# Clozapine Adverse Event Analysis

This repository contains a series of notebooks that explore the **adverse events (AEs)** associated with **Clozapine**, an antipsychotic drug used primarily to treat **schizophrenia**. Using real-world data from the **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)**, accessed via the **OpenFDA API**, these analyses focus on uncovering **safety signals**, examining **patient demographics**, and understanding **AE patterns** through advanced data science techniques.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. **Clozapine Adverse Event Characterization and Demographic Analysis**
In this first notebook, I explore the types of adverse events most commonly reported for Clozapine and examine how they affect different demographic groups.

**Key topics include:**
- **Characterizing reported adverse events**: Identifying the most commonly reported AEs associated with Clozapine, such as **neutropenia**, **leukopenia**, and **granulocytopenia**.
- **Demographic analysis**: Investigating whether specific patient characteristics, like **age** and **gender**, influence the likelihood of experiencing the most common AEs.

### 2. **Clozapine Adverse Event Time-to-Onset and Cumulative Risk**
This notebook focuses on understanding **when** adverse events occur after the initiation of Clozapine treatment and how the **cumulative risk** of experiencing these events evolves over time.

**Key topics include:**
- **Time-to-onset analysis**: Exploring the time it takes for specific AEs to manifest after starting Clozapine.
- **Cumulative risk analysis**: Using **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis** to assess how the likelihood of AEs increases over time and identifying **high-risk periods** for specific events.

### 3. **Adverse Event Co-occurrence Patterns and Machine Learning for Predictive Safety Signals** *(Coming Soon)*

This notebook employs advanced data science techniques to uncover patterns in **AE co-occurrence** and predict the likelihood of certain AEs using **machine learning models**.

**Key topics include:**
- **Adverse Event Co-occurrence Patterns (Association Rule Mining)**: Using **association rule mining** to explore how different AEs tend to occur together in the same patients. For example, identifying whether **neutropenia** and **leukopenia** often co-occur, or if certain clusters of AEs (e.g., **blood-related** and **cardiovascular issues**) appear in the same patient population.
- **Machine Learning for Predictive Safety Signals**: Developing **predictive models** to estimate the likelihood of patients developing specific AEs based on characteristics such as **age**, **gender**, **duration of treatment**, and **co-medications**.

### 4. **Convert AE PT to SOC Mapping for Clozapine Using ChatGPT**
In this notebook, I use **ChatGPT** to map **MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs)** to their corresponding **System Organ Classes (SOCs)**. This mapping is crucial for standardizing AE data and ensuring that analyses are aligned with established medical taxonomies.

**Key topics include:**
- **Automating PT to SOC mapping**: Leveraging **ChatGPT** to generate accurate PT to SOC mappings and streamline the process of categorizing adverse events.
- **Dataset standardization**: Using the generated mappings to standardize AE data for use in subsequent analyses.
